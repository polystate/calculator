The Odin Project #4 - Calculator Project

2/24/2021 - Added basic functionality and basic design. Using a combination of flexbox and grid.

2/25/2021 - Basic calculations work through the inputs. Panel clearing is working. However, decimal point is still buggy and needs to be fixed next. That along with the number replacing the 'answer' system.

2/28/2021 - Backspace functionality working. Decimal system is now working. A couple of bugs still to fix with backspace on longer numbers. New design added.

2/28/2021 7:38 PM - If a large number exceeds the width of the display panel, it will now use the toExponential() method to automatically convert the answer to scientific notation to avoid any overcrowding. Decimal points also trimmed using toFixed() method. Number style changed to make number look more matrix like. Also added square root and factorial for funziez with cute infinite popup if you decide to use factorial liberally.
