The Odin Project #4 - Calculator Project

2/24/2021 - Added basic functionality and basic design. Using a combination of flexbox and grid.

2/25/2021 - Basic calculations work through the inputs. Panel clearing is working. However, decimal point is still buggy and needs to be fixed next. That along with the number replacing the 'answer' system.
